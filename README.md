## Usage

In your new project add folder `runner`. This dir for shell scripts(bash). Put `entrypoint.sh` script in `runner` this script will run first.
Next step. Put in project `Makefile`.

```
# Build rootfs for php

build:
	@docker run --rm \
		-v $(CURDIR)/runner:/runner \
		-v $(CURDIR)/build:/build \
		-v $(CURDIR)/src:/src \
		imega/base-builder \
# this packages installed for your image
		--packages=" \
			git \
			php7@edge-testing \
			" \
# this packages installed for auxiliary tools
		-d="curl"

.PHONY: build
```

-   -p --packages - this packages installed for your image
-   -d --dev-packages - this packages installed for auxiliary tools

## Start build

`make build`

You will receive a rootfs.tar.gz in a folder build.

## Build your image

Put Docker file in project. e.g.

```
FROM scratch

ADD build/rootfs.tar.gz /

ENTRYPOINT ["php"]
```

run `$docker run build -t test-image .`

## Runner scripts

You are allowed to use variables:

-   \$ROOTFS - This directory is the root of the file system.
-   \$SRC - This directory will be mounted in builder.

e.g.

You need to transfer configs in their way. Configs you place in `SRC` directory. Put command in `entrypoint.sh`

```
cp $SRC/daemon.sh $ROOTFS/app/daemon.sh
cp $SRC/rsyncd.conf $ROOTFS/etc/rsyncd.conf
```
